# Cybersapient_Assignment
# Gold Price Analysis
This code performs an analysis of gold price data using various techniques such as time series decomposition, stationarity testing, differencing, linear regression modeling, and evaluation.

# Required Libraries
 The following libraries are imported to run the code: <br>
•	pandas for data manipulation and analysis <br>
•	numpy for numerical computations <br>
•	matplotlib.pyplot for plotting <br>
•	statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose for time series decomposition <br>
•	statsmodels.tsa.stattools.adfuller for the augmented Dickey-Fuller test <br>
•	statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots.plot_acf and statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots.plot_pacf for autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots <br>
•	sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split for splitting the data into train and test sets <br>
•	sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression for linear regression modeling <br>
•	sklearn.metrics.r2_score for calculating the R-squared score <br>

# Loading and Preparing the Data
•	The OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data is loaded from an Excel file using pd.read_excel. <br>
•	The 'Date' column is converted to datetime format using pd.to_datetime. <br>
•	The 'Date' column is set as the index of the DataFrame using df.set_index('Date', inplace=True). <br>
•	The DataFrame is sorted by date in ascending order using df.sort_index(ascending=True, inplace=True). <br>
•	Optionally, you can resample the data to a different frequency by uncommenting the line df = df.resample('M').mean(). This line resamples the data to monthly frequency by taking the mean of each month's data.<br>

# Visualizing the Data
•	The closing prices are plotted over time using plt.plot(df['Close']) to provide an overview of the gold price trends. <br>

# Time Series Decomposition
•	The seasonal_decompose function is applied to the closing prices (df['Close']) to decompose the series into its trend, seasonality, and residual components. <br>
•	A figure with four subplots is created to visualize the original data, trend, seasonality, and residuals using plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(12, 10)). <br>
•	Each subplot is plotted using axes[i].plot() and labeled accordingly. <br>
•	The plots are displayed using plt.tight_layout() and plt.show(). <br>

# Stationarity Testing
•	A function named adf_test is defined to perform the augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity. <br>
•	The augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied to the closing prices (df['Close']) using adf_test(df['Close']). <br>
•	Differencing is performed on the closing prices to make the series stationary (df['Differenced_Close'] = df['Close'].diff()). <br>
•	The augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied to the differenced series (adf_test(df['Differenced_Close'])). <br>

#Linear Regression Modeling
•	Daily price changes are calculated by differencing the closing prices (df['Price_Change'] = df['Close'].diff()). <br>
•	The first row (NaN) is removed since it has no price change (df = df[1:]). <br>
•	The data is split into train and test sets using an 80-20 split ratio (train_data, test_data = df[:train_size], df[train_size:]). <br>
•	The feature and target variables are prepared (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test). <br>
•	A linear regression model is created and trained using LinearRegression(). <br>
•	Predictions are made on the training and test sets using model.predict(). <br>
•	The R-squared scores are calculated for the training and test sets using r2_score(). <br>
•	The R-squared scores are printed. <br>

# Model Evaluation
•	The actual vs. predicted price changes are plotted using plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred_test). <br>
•	The residuals are calculated by subtracting the predicted price changes from the actual price changes (residuals = y_test - y_pred_test). <br>
•	A residual plot is created by plotting the actual price changes against the residuals using plt.scatter(y_test, residuals). <br>
•	A horizontal line at y=0 is added to the residual plot using plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--'). <br>
•	Both plots are displayed using plt.show(). <br>
